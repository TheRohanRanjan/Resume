<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Rohan Ranjan, the eldest son of first-generation immigrant parents. I reflect the lessons they've learned from their experiences and challenges. From a young age, I was taught that hard work is the key to success. I'm always looking to improve and grow.</p>
  
<p> I began my Web Developer journey the summer of 2024 after a rough and jam packed 2nd semester of college. I've had previous experience coding, but I found Web Developing is a different side to coding.
  Instead of math and logic, its much more design and creativitiy oriented. It's a nice switch up compared to Python, and C++.
</p>

<p> Outside of Web Developing, I love to be active and hangout with friends. I love to play sports and hike. I also like sitting down and watching movies or reading books.</p>
